# SIChess

Trying to create a chess game using Java Swing. Mastering OOP principles. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to try the game, you should install .zip file, unpack it, and run Main.java (/src/main/java/com/example/SIChess
/Chess/Main.java)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project's purpose - fully designed web application.
At this moment the project is close to the middle of production. As of now, you can see the board with pieces. The pieces are moving properly.
Things to create: 
1. Gameplay - checks, hidden checks, double checks and checkmates are soon to come. - I suppose it's the most sophisticated part to build.
2. Web interface - authorization, game of chess, profiles and more...
Maybe I will make it a cross-platform app, but I highly doubt it :)
