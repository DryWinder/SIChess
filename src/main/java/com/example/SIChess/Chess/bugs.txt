1. When dragging piece it shifts this piece one square up and left
For example: piece on e4 -> d3
2. Sometimes it can move 2+ pieces in move, instead of 1.

--- This bugs are solved! :) ---

3. If mouse while dragging gets out of layeredPane there can be Null exception

4. Make all поля private - done

md format

make hashmap for exceptions in main

кінцевий автомат(state machine)

logs instead of prints

few public methods in classes, many private if there is a need

make separate method for every if-condition

Constructor cannot throw Exceptions


Logic for a piece move:

1. Drag piece to selected square
2. If selected square is not valid to move this piece - return to previousSquare, and move again
3. Else - set new Location to this piece
